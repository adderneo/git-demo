## Ipsum Below

@Sammy: Removing a single directory from the PATH variable is best done through the GUI, I assume. I don't know how to quickly remove it from the command line. If you want to completely remove an environment variable, you can use set something=, but I wouldn't advise you to do that for PATH. – Der Hochstapler

### some more ipsum

This is worth noting: "Changes made with SET will remain only for the duration of the current CMD session." This can be found here. And it says that Set command is used to display, set, or remove CMD environment variables. So Set command can be used to remove the whole variable, in this example the PATH variable. And again, it will not be permanently removed from Windows. It is only valid for the duration of the CMD session. To permanently set an environment variable from CMD, the Setx command should be used instead. Either that or GUI. – Samir Jun 13 '13 at 22:09
